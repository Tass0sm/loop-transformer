- Apply transformations specified by pragmas in the file fdtd-apml.ppcg.c.in,
  and write the transformed file to fdtd-apml.ppcg.c.

: ./transform.sh fdtd-apml.ppcg

- The definition of ppcg_min and ppcg_max are commented out in the *.in files
  because it breaks the parser. Need to uncomment them before compiling.

- Compile fdtd-apml.ppcg.c and execute it in three ways. It should compare the
  sequential, unmodified kernel with the transformed kernel in sequential and
  parallel modes.

: ./check.sh fdtd-apml.ppcg
